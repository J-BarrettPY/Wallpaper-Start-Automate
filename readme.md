# Wallpaper-Start-Automate
### Wallpaper Engine - Steam Application

Literally just automates the process of starting your wallpaper from Wallpaper engine.
Thats it. Thats the meme.

Pretty sure Wallpaper engine doesnt support this feature because they wanna get player hours from Steam.
But we automate. We dont wait 10 seconds to do this ourselves. Were better than that.

## Instructions

- Download .ps1 or make your own or whatever.
- Add .ps1 file to whatever directory and then add a path in your registry run: [`Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`]
- Restart your computer and yeet

## Warnings

- Dont download random .ps1 files from the internet. Lol. At least verify the content.
- Do NOT modify your Registry if you dont know what you're doing.
